# Team-calendar
Simple application using flask to create a web-based interactive calendar for the team
The application creates a database and in it stores events. 
A person with access to the application can directly add his/her instructions for a given day such as remote work, stationary work or absence in the view of the month or working week. 
This crud application is designed to make communication within the team easier, without the need to use external services or edit calendars in outlook.
